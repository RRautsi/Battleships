# Battleships
### Small game I made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

This is a personal side project that I wanted to make while studying Full Stack web development at Opiframe Oy.

### Features
This game has some basic functionalities:

- Drag&Drop for player ships, made with HTML Drag and Drop API. You can't place ships onto each other or out of bounds.

- Random ship placement for computer. Computer ships cannot spawn on each other or out of bounds. It has been taken care of with recursive ship placement function.

- Random index shooting for computer so computer is easy to win. I might improve "AI" some day.

- Tried to make the UI as responsive as possible so you can play it with any screen size. It should not look out of place when adjusting browser size.

### Future improvements
- I have thought of adding multiplayer at some point. This would require express and websocket.

- Implement computer AI that can play better.
