# Battleships
### Small game I made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

This is a personal side project that I wanted to make while studying Full Stack web development at Opiframe Oy.

### Features
This game has some basic functionalities:

- Drag&Drop for player ships, made with HTML Drag and Drop API. Corner cases have been taken care of. You can't place ships onto each other or out of bounds.
- Random ship placement for computer. Computer ships cannot spawn on each other and it has been taken care of with recursive ship placement.
- Random number shooting for computer so computer is easy to win. I might improve "AI" of the computer some day.
- Tried to make the UI as responsive as possible so you can play it with any screen size. It should not look wonky when adjusting browser size.
